# Electromagnetism Notes

## â–¸ About ðŸ“–

This repository contains the source code of my personal notes (in Thai) on **Electromagnetism**, written in $\LaTeX$. These notes are a product of my study of *"Introduction to Electrodynamics"* by David J. Griffiths, supplemented with other materials I see fit. I've also included the compiled PDF file [here](main.pdf) for ease of access, but note that it may not always be the most up-to-date version.

These notes are a **work in progress** and meant for **personal use**, so it is *very* incomplete and may contain errors, omissions, or unclear explanations. Please donâ€™t rely on them as an authoritative source (or even as a source to study Electromagnetism, honestly). That said, I do hope it can still serve as useful to maybe at least 3 people.

This repository is public only for convenience, so I'd prefer it not be forked. If youâ€™d like to suggest improvements or corrections and you know me, feel free to reach out.

## â–¸ Credits ðŸ’³

A big thanks to Evan Chen for inspiring much of my preamble and formatting. Parts of my preamble are adapted from his [`evan.sty`](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty). The preamble is currently in a separate private repository, but you can still see the older parts of it in previous commits.

## â–¸ References ðŸ”Ž
